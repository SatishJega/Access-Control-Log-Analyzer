# 🛡️ Access Control Log Analyzer

## 📌 Project Overview
As a Technical Officer managing security infrastructure, I often deal with thousands of access logs. Manual review is slow and prone to human error.

I created this Python tool to **automate threat detection** in physical access control systems (PACS).

## ⚙️ How It Works
The script mimics a **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** rule:
1. **Ingests** raw log data (simulated CSV).
2. **Analyzes** user behavior in real-time.
3. **Flags** "Brute Force" entry attempts (e.g., trying a keycard 5+ times in 1 minute).
4. **Alerts** the security team automatically.

## 🚀 Why I Built This
To demonstrate how physical security logic can be translated into automated code. By mirroring SIEM principles, this tool reduces incident response times and strengthens compliance for large-scale enterprise and hospitality environments.
